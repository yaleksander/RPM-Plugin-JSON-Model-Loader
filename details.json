This will replace the object's mesh (the graphics). You can then change the model's properties and animate it. This plugin comes with an \"on map load\" event. Create a custom event for your game and assign its ID to the plugin's parameter. Your event will now trigger on map load.\n\nGeneral tips: loading models can cause momentary lag (during the load process only). Try to load all the models you want on the map in one go, and make a loading screen to mask it. There's an \"on all models load\" event to help with that, which triggers when a set number of frames passes after the last model's been loaded, but only once per map. The map objects with assigned GLTF models are treated as regular 3D map objects, so they have a direction. If you want to control the object's direction via plugin only, make sure to check the \"direction fix\" box on the map object. You can then retrieve the rotation (in degrees) on the Y (vertical) axis. This will account for the plugin rotation only. Finally, you can use the \"get model info\" method to retrieve the model's size and animations list.","name":"GLTF Loader","parameters":[{"defaultValue":{"k":8,"v":"./Content/Datas/Scripts/Plugins/GLTF Loader/models/"},"description":"Directory where the game will look for your 3D models (starting from <your game directory>/resources/app/)","id":-1,"name":"Models directory path"},{"defaultValue":{"k":12,"v":4},"description":"ID of the event to be called by the plugin when the map loads","id":-1,"name":"Map load event ID"},{"description":"ID of the event to be called by the plugin when there are no more models on queue to be loaded on the map (only once per map)","id":-1,"name":"All models loaded event ID"}],"version":"2.0.0"}
