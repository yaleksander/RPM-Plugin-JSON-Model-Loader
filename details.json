This will replace the object's mesh (the graphics). You can then change the model's properties and animate it. The methods names are self explanatory, and they come with descriptions just in case.\n\nGeneral tips: loading models can cause momentary lag (during the load process only). Try to load all the models you want on the map in one go, and make a loading screen to mask it. You can call the \"trigger event\" method to trigger a custom event as soon as the loading is done. The map objects with assigned GLTF models are treated as regular 3D map objects, so they have a direction. If you want to control the object's direction via plugin only, make sure to check the \"direction fix\" box on the map object. You can then retrieve the rotation (in degrees) on the Y (vertical) axis. This will account for the plugin rotation only. Finally, you can use the \"get model info\" method to retrieve the model's size and animations list.","name":"GLTF Loader","parameters":[{"defaultValue":{"k":8,"v":"./Content/Datas/Scripts/Plugins/GLTF Loader/models/"},"description":"Directory where the game will look for your 3D models (starting from <your game directory>/resources/app/)","id":-1,"name":"Models directory path"}],"version":"2.0.1"}
