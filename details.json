Download or create GLTF/GLB animated models and convert them at https://threejs.org/editor/\n\nWARNINGS: export your files as objects, not as scenes, otherwise animations might fail. This plugin does NOT handle separate texture files. Please export your model with built-in textures. This plugin is currently not compatible with the \"Lights\" plugin due to the nature of the materials/textures of imported GLTF/GLB files.\n\nHow to use: first, load the model you want into a map object. This will replace the object's mesh (the graphics). You can then offset, rotate, scale and animate the model. The model will stay anchored to a map object. When the map is reloaded, the models revert back to normal. Be mindful of the object's direction! If you want it to be controlled via plugin only, remember to check the \"direction fix\" box on the map object. When rotating the model, the Y (vertical) axis is the one responsible for default north/south/east/west rotations, so it's best not to rotate the model on the X and Z axes unless you know what you're doing. When in doubt on how to animate your model, use the \"get model info\" method. This will list the available animations your model has.","name":"JSON Model Loader","parameters":[{"defaultValue":{"k":8,"v":"./Content/Datas/Scripts/Plugins/JSON Model Loader/models/"},"description":"Directory where the game will look for your 3D models (starting from <your game directory>/resources/app/)","id":-1,"name":"Models directory path"},{"defaultValue":{"k":12,"v":4},"description":"ID of the event to be called by the plugin","id":-1,"name":"Map load event ID"}],"version":"1.0.3"}
